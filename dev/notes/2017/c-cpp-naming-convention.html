		<h1>Another talking about C/C++ naming convention</h1>
        <p>Category: <a>Programming Language</a>. Tag: <a>C/C++</a></p>

        <p>Announcement:</p>
        <p>This is maybe a topic that quite a few people are sick of reading, just like me. Yes, I have read too many discussions, 
        or debates actually, since almost a decade ago, when I started to write the first line of C++ code. It seems there is no 
        large devergence in the naming convention of C programming. Lower case is used naturally. Some people use more under-scores, 
        and some use more abbreviations, but few assert any one is better. While in C++ the situation get complicated. </p>
        <p>Anyway, I thought this is not a topic that deserves much more discussions. It does not mean I think this is not a 
        serious issue. Actually, I think it is very important for a programmer to understand the naming conventions of 
        predominant languages and follow one if necessary. The naming convention is more about preference for a
        programmer, while a rule for a project. Nothing is perfect, so is any naming convention. I have followed a consistent 
        naming convention in the past years in my own projects, but I decided to change something recently. Again, I do not think 
        this is a choice of better or not. It is just a change of preference. I do not intend to introduce or discuss the details 
        about C++ naming conventions here. I just record my change and my thinking about it.</p>

        <h2>I don't like all lowercase name.</h2>
        <p>The title illustrates the predominant conventions of naming file, class, function, and variable. I had always followed 
        camelCase in the naming of functions and variables. 


        <h2>File name: lowercase, under_score, PascalCase?</h2>
        <p>It seems there is a predominant convention about the naming of C++ files, which is using all lower-case name, based on  
        below facts: 
        <p>As above menthioned, some people like to use under score in the file names for readability, and some else like to use 
        abbreviation to shorten the file name.</p>
        <p>Same here, these are only conventions or preferencees. You can always find many C++ projects using PascalCase file name.
        I prefer PascalCase file name too and have used it in all my own projects.</p>
        
        <h2>I don't like camelCase.</h2>
        
        <h2>I like a prefix for member varibles.</h2>
